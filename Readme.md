# WINTER-BOOTCAMP-PROJECT
project on image processing

Hello this project is about IMAGE PROCESSING functions and we learn: -> Configure and run an opencv project in visual studio -> Read and show images -> Rotate the image

REQUIREMENTS:- -> Opencv -> Visual Studio

PREREQUITIES:- Opencv and visual studio installed locally , depending upon OS

HOW TO RUN:- starting with some basic image processing operations using opencv libraries in c++ programming language. 1-> must include opencv libraries in the first line of code: #include<opencv2/opencv.hpp>

2-> READ AND SHOW IMAGE for this we use iostream libraries and we should include it to code ex- #include<opencv2/opencv.hpp> #include using namespace std; using namespace cv; void main() {..  }

hence, in this way project for image processing is made using opencv.

 OBJECTIVE of this project-
 to fill a 9x9 grid with digits in such a way such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 grids that made up the larger 9x9 grid contain all of the digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.
